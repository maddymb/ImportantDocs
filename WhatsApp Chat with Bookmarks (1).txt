New Changes in Selenium 3.0
 Minimum Java version required is 1.8+

Firefox is fully supported at version 47.0.1 or earlier. Gecko driver provides support
for later versions of Firefox. Firefox 47.0.1 and before would not need GeckoDriver
Selenium project will not actively support the WebDriver API.
The Selenium RC APIs are only available via the legacy-rc package.
Support Firefox browser via Mozilla’s gecko driver.
Selenium 3.0 does not have HeadLess Driver (HtmlWebDriver)
Official support for IE browser requires 9 or above version.
No need to maximize the browser using driver.manage().window().maximize(); By default it will maximize the window.
Apple has come up with its own SafariDriver to run your tests in Safari on Mac
Selenium RC core library won’t be supported.
Selenium WebDriver has become the W3C Standard. The W3C standard will encourage compatibility across different software implementations of WebDriver API.
All WebDrivers are moved out of selenium and vendors will be responsible for owning the drivers for maintenance, which will be the relief for maintenance team or open source team to get better implementation.
Issues found in Selenium 3.0
Unsupported Marionette protocol version 2, required 3 when our Firefox is 64 bit.
driver.close() is not working
Minimum Java version required is now 8+
